## About the project
This was the final project for an FSD bootcamp at GeeksHubs Academy. The project consisted in designing and making a full webapp from scratch, back and front. This is the front of the project. I decided to make an app for teachers to create groups, students and tasks and easily mark the tasks and get the correctly weighted final marks for each student.

## Goal
The project required us to make a front-end application in react. It also required the following views and features:

- Home view
- Register view
- Login view
- Editable profile
- Crud of group
- Crud of student
- crud of tasks
- crud of marks

## Features

- Refetches, fetch caching, fetch invalidation when another fetch is requested. 

- Responsive design

- Dynamic header that changes depending on the view.

- AI chat (comming soon): AI chat to help plan your classes and prepare tasks.

## Credentials
    These are some of the credentials provided in the seeder.
    - user@user.com password: Aa123456 (user)

## Decisions

- The design tries to minimize calls to the api.

## Roadmap
- Add Ai chat
- Add session crud
- Add calendar view
- Reimplement user token revocation
- Reimplement google login
- Reimplement delete functions
- Implement Attendance lists
- Add the possibility to add tags to tasks
- Add the possibility of reusing a student in other groups
- Add the possibility of reusing a task in other groups
- Add group grading scale settings to customize how the marks are displayed and requested


## Known issues
- The delete functions were removed temporarily due to issues with the cluster.
- Likewise the attendance was removed due to issues with the cluster.
- Sometimes CreateMarks view fails on first access. (Being investigated)
